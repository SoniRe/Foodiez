We don't want to push console.log() or comments into our production app. I want to minify those file
Do bundling, image optimization and many more things before it goes to production

Many packages with React make it fast
This package.json file is configuration for npm (in JSON structure). It keeps track of version of packages
If Our package is dependent on other packages then it is called dependencies. 

The most important package in our app is :
Bundler(Vite, webpack, parcel)  - Packages our app so that it can be shipped to production

create-react-app uses webpack behind the scenes

There are 2 types of packages we can install:
1) Dev Dependency (Required in development mode) (use this command -D )
2) Normal Dependency 

"devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.10.0"
 }

Caret(^) - It will install all minor updates
Tilde(~) - It will install major updates

package.json - It keeps the track of approx version 
package-lock.json - It keeps the track of exact version
