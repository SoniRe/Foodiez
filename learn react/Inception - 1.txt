//Basic code to add Hello World to root element 
<script>
      const heading = document.createElement("h1");
      heading.innerHTML = "Hello world from javascript";

      const root = document.querySelector("#root");
      root.appendChild(heading)
 </script>

Browser only understands react and doesn't know react

crossorigin 

react  - it is the main core file
react-dom - it is used to modify DOM which we will need

Two files are there because react is core file and react-dom is what we need , there are more
like react-native, react-3d

<script>
      //we are deriving core things(like and element) which comes from react
      const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Namaste from react");

      //root is the place where all things will render
      //we use ReactDOM as its included in DOM part
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.querySelector("#root"));

      // now render the heading in root
      root.render(heading);
</script>
