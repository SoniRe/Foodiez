useEffect - useEffect will be called after every time component is rendered

if no dependency array => useEffect is called on every render
if dependency array is empty = [] => useEffect is called only once at initial render
if you have something as dependency = [btnNameReact] => useEffect is called every time dependency(btnNameReact) changes
