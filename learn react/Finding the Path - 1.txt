useEffect - useEffect will be called after every time component is rendered

if no dependency array => useEffect is called on every render
if dependency array is empty = [] => useEffect is called only once at initial render
if you have something as dependency = [btnNameReact] => useEffect is called every time dependency(btnNameReact) changes

React Router DOM

const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout />,
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    element: <About />,
  },
]);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />);

React Router gives a special Hook called useRouteError 

const AppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <div id="app">
      <Header />
      <Outlet />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};

//In place of outlet children component will be rendered come as path changes

const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout />,
    children: [
      {
        path: "/",
        element: <Body />,
      },
      {
        path: "/about",
        element: <About />,
      },
      {
        path: "/contact",
        element: <Contact />,
      },
    ],
    errorElement: <Error />,
  },
]);

Never use anchor tag to route from one page to another. Because it reloads the whole page. While using <Link /> only component
gets refreshed

React helps us create single page application

There can be 2 types of routing in web applications:-
1) Client Side Routing - Now it doesn't make network call for fetching another page.
2) Server Side Routing - Earlier we used to make network call to server to get another html page.
