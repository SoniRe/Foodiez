There is no recommended way for structuring files 

You can use the .. operator as many times as you need to navigate up multiple levels in the file directory structure. For example, if you have a file called ./../../helpers.js in three levels up from the current directory, you can import it using the following code:

import { add, subtract } from './../../helpers';

1 File can have only 1 default export
For multiple exports use Named export

Two Types of export and import 
1) Default Export and Import
2) Named Export and Import

- Default Export/Import

  export default Component
  import Component from "path"

- Named Export/Import

  export {Component}
  import {Component} from "path"

-> Can we have default export and Named export
   Yes we can have default as well as Named export
