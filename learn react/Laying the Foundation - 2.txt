JSX => React.createElement => ReactElement- JS Object => HTML Element(rendered)

Attributes are given in camelCase.If you want to write JSX in multiple lines we wrap it inside () paranthesis
const jsxHeading = (<h1 className="head">Hello 
I'm here boy
</h1>);


 React Component
- Class Based Component - Old ways to build code (It uses Javascript classes)
- Function Based Component - New way to build code (It uses Javascript functions)

React Functional Component - Just a javascript function (Name it capital letter)
that returns a React element
const HeadingComponent = () => {
  return <h1>Namaste React Functional Component</h1>;
};

		or

const HeadingComponent = () => <h1>Namaste React Functional Component</h1>;



const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div id="container">
    <Title />   => This is a component composition meaning component composes another component
    <h1>Namaste React Functional Component</h1>
  </div>
);

Can write in Normal Function format
const Title = function () {
  return (
    <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
      Hello I'm here boy
    </h1>
  );
};

Can Inject JS code into JSX code

Cross-side scripting - an attack in which an attacker injects malicious executable scripts into the code 
			of a trusted application or website

JSX takes care of cross-side scripting attack because React doesn't blindly run the code

- Babel and Parcel role in JSX?
  Parcel automatically supports JSX when it detects that you are using this in code

- What are Components?
  Components are resusable bits of code

- What is type attribute in script tag?
  This attribute indicates the type of script represented. The value of this attribute 
  will be one of the following:

 module: This value causes the code to be treated as a JavaScript module.
 importmap: This value indicates that the body of the element contains an import map
