  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html",
    "test": "jest"
  },

Create scripts to run the commands
now, we can write npm run start / npm start => npx parcel index.html

//React Element => Object => HTMLElement(rendered component)
//Created element using core react
const heading = React.createElement("h1", { id: "heading" }, "Hello I'm here");

console.log(heading);
//JSX - Javascript syntax which is easier to create HTML element
//JSX is seperate and React is seperate, it is used bcz its developer friendly

// JSX(its a syntax) - is not HTML in Javascript, it's HTML or XML like syntax
const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">Hello I'm here boy</h1>;

console.log(jsxHeading);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(jsxHeading);

Transpiling converts source code from a programming language into an equivalent source code of the 
same or a different programming language
example - Parcel transpiles the JSX code into React code before it reaches the javascript engine

Parcel gives this code to Babel to convert it into code which react will understand
